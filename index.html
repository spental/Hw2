                        Hello, I'm Kyle! <br />
                        Who am i ?<br />
                        My name is Kyle Talbott; I am originally from Gloucester, Virginia. Upon graduating high school,
                        I graduated from Old Dominion University in 20012 with a bachelor of science degree. After
                        working
                        at two local elementary schools and finding a passion for teaching, I returned to ODU in 2014. I
                        obtained a Virginia teaching license endorsed in Health and Physical Education K-12 and
                        Technology
                        Education. At this time, my father was being diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers, so I
                        eventually
                        moved back to Gloucester and started teaching high school technology and helping my mother care
                        for my
                        father. Teaching others has helped me personally grow in so many ways over the past five years.
                        Telling
                        students constantly not to be afraid of challenging themselves and always chase after what they
                        want in
                        life has led to me being encouraged and motivated to chase my dreams. I would love to
                        understand, design,
                        implement and maintain accessible technology as a career. I find computer language fascinating.
                        I am
                        looking forward to mastering these skills one day so that maybe I can open a coding school for
                        young
                        learners trying to build a career skill set.
